  abstract = {Psychiatric disorders constitute one of the main causes of disability worldwide. During the past years, considerable research has been conducted on the genetic architecture of such diseases, although little understanding of their etiology has been achieved. The difficulty to access up-to-date, relevant genotype-phenotype information has hampered the application of this wealth of knowledge to translational research and clinical practice in order to improve diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric patients. PsyGeNET (http://www.psygenet.org/) has been developed with the aim of supporting research on the genetic architecture of psychiatric diseases, by providing integrated and structured accessibility to their genotype\textendash{}phenotype association data, together with analysis and visualization tools. In this article, we describe the protocol developed for the sustainable update of this knowledge resource. It includes the recruitment of a team of domain experts in order to perform the curation of the data extracted by text mining. Annotation guidelines and a web-based annotation tool were developed to support the curators' tasks. A curation workflow was designed including a pilot phase and two rounds of curation and analysis phases. Negative evidence from the literature on gene\textendash{}disease associations (GDAs) was taken into account in the curation process. We report the results of the application of this workflow to the curation of GDAs for PsyGeNET, including the analysis of the inter-annotator agreement and suggest this model as a suitable approach for the sustainable development and update of knowledge resources.,

  shorttitle = {Text Mining Applications in Psychiatry},
  abstract = {The expansion of biomedical literature is creating the need for efficient tools to keep pace with increasing volumes of information. Text mining (TM) approaches are becoming essential to facilitate the automated extraction of useful biomedical information from unstructured text. We reviewed the applications of TM in psychiatry, and explored its advantages and limitations. A systematic review of the literature was carried out using the CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane databases. In this review, 1103 papers were screened, and 38 were included as applications of TM in psychiatric research. Using TM and content analysis, we identified four major areas of application: (1) Psychopathology (i.e. observational studies focusing on mental illnesses) (2) the Patient perspective (i.e. patients' thoughts and opinions), (3) Medical records (i.e. safety issues, quality of care and description of treatments), and (4) Medical literature (i.e. identification of new scientific information in the literature). The information sources were qualitative studies, Internet postings, medical records and biomedical literature. Our work demonstrates that TM can contribute to complex research tasks in psychiatry. We discuss the benefits, limits, and further applications of this tool in the future. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background
We have previously reported on the development of a cancer-specific screening instrument for anxiety and depression (PSSCAN). No information on cut-off scores or their meaning for diagnosis was available when PSSCAN was first described. Needed were additional analyses to recommend empirically justified cut-off scores as well as data norms for healthy adult samples so as to lend meaning to the recommended cut-off scores.

Methods
We computed sensitivity/specificity indices based on a sample of 101 cancer patients who had provided PSSCAN data on anxiety and depression and who had completed another standardized instrument with strong psychometrics. Next, we compared mean scores for four samples with known differences in health status, a healthy community sample (n = 561), a sample of patients with a representative mix of cancer subtypes (n = 570), a more severely ill sample of in-patients with cancer (n = 78), and a community sample with a chronic illness other than cancer (n = 85).

Results
Sensitivity/specificity analyses revealed that an excellent balance of sensitivity/specificity was achievable with 92\%/98\% respectively for clinical anxiety and 100\% and 86\% respectively for clinical depression. Newly diagnosed patients with cancer were no more anxious than healthy community controls but showed elevations in depression scores. Both, patients with chronic illness other than cancer and those with longer-standing cancer diagnoses revealed greater levels of distress than newly diagnosed cancer patients or healthy adult controls.

Conclusion
These additional data on criterion validity and community versus patient norms for PSSCAN serve to enhance its utility for clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The existing body of work regarding discourse coherence in aphasia has provided mixed results, leaving the question of coherence being impaired or intact as a result of brain injury unanswered. In this study, discourse coherence in non-brain-damaged (NBD) speakers and speakers with anomic aphasia was investigated quantitatively and qualitatively.Method: Fifteen native speakers of Cantonese with anomic aphasia and 15 NBD participants produced 60 language samples. Elicitation tasks included story-telling induced by a picture series and a procedural description. The samples were annotated for discourse structure in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) in order to analyse a number of structural parameters. After that 20 na{\"i}ve listeners rated coherence of each sample.Result: Disordered discourse was rated as significantly less coherent. The NBD group demonstrated a higher production fluency than the participants with aphasia and used a richer set of semantic relations to create discourse, particularly in the description of settings, expression of causality, and extent of elaboration. People with aphasia also tended to omit essential information content.Conclusion: Reduced essential information content, lower degree of elaboration, and a larger amount of structural disruptions may have contributed to the reduced overall discourse coherence in speakers with anomic aphasia.},

  issn = {1473-8716},
  abstract = {In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth of asynchronous online conversations (e.g. blogs), thanks to the rise of social media. Analyzing and gaining insights from such discussions can be quite challenging for a user, especially when the user deals with hundreds of comments that are scattered around multiple different conversations. A promising solution to this problem is to automatically mine the major topics from conversations and organize them into a hierarchical structure. However, the resultant topic hierarchy can be noisy and/or it may not match the user's current information needs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop approach that allows the user to revise the topic hierarchy based on her feedback. We incorporate this approach within a visual text analytics system that helps users in analyzing and getting insights from conversations by exploring and revising the topic hierarchy. We evaluated the resulting system with real users in a lab-based study. The results from the user study, when compared to its counterpart that does not support interactive revisions of a hierarchical topic model, provide empirical evidence of the potential utility of our system in terms of both performance and subjective measures. Finally, we summarize generalizable lessons for introducing human-in-the-loop computation within a visual text analytics system.},

  abstract = {An incisive understanding of user personality is not only essential to many scientific disciplines, but also has a profound business impact on practical applications such as digital marketing, personalized recommendation, mental diagnosis, and human resources management. Previous studies have demonstrated that language usage in social media is effective in personality prediction. However, except for single language features, a less researched direction is how to leverage the heterogeneous information on social media to have a better understanding of user personality. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Information Ensemble framework, called HIE, to predict users' personality traits by integrating heterogeneous information including self-language usage, avatar, emoticon, and responsive patterns. In our framework, to improve the performance of personality prediction, we have designed different strategies extracting semantic representations to fully leverage heterogeneous information on social media. We evaluate our methods with extensive experiments based on a real-world data covering both personality survey results and social media usage from thousands of volunteers. The results reveal that our approaches significantly outperform several widely adopted state-of-the-art baseline methods. To figure out the utility of HIE in a real-world interactive setting, we also present DiPsy, a personalized chatbot to predict user personality through heterogeneous information in digital traces and conversation logs.},

  volume = {120},
  issn = {0008-543X},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND
The authors investigated the prevalence, determinants of, and disparities in any perceived unmet need for 8 supportive services (home nurse, support group, psychological services, social worker, physical/occupational rehabilitation, pain management, spiritual counseling, and smoking cessation) by race/ethnicity and nativity and how it is associated with perceived quality of care among US patients with lung cancer.

METHODS
Data from a multiregional, multihealth system representative cohort of 4334 newly diagnosed patients were analyzed. Binomial logistic regression models adjusted for patient clustering.

RESULTS
Patients with any perceived unmet need (9\% overall) included 7\% of white\textendash{}US-born (USB), 9\% of white\textendash{}foreign-born (FB), 13\% of black-USB, 8\% of Latino-USB, 24\% of Latino-FB, 4\% of Asian/Pacific Islander (API)-USB, 14\% of API-FB, and 11\% of ``other'' patients (P {$<$}.001). Even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors, health system and health care access, and need, black-USB, Latino-FB, and Asian-FB patients were more likely to perceive an unmet need than white-USB patients by 5.1, 10.9, and 5.6 percentage points, respectively (all P{$<$}.05). Being younger, female, never married, uninsured, a current smoker, or under surrogate care or having comorbidity, anxiety/depression, or a cost/insurance barrier to getting tests/treatments were associated with any unmet need. Patients with any unmet need were more likely to rate care as less-than-``excellent'' by 13 percentage points than patients with no unmet need (P{$<$}.001).

CONCLUSIONS
Significant disparities in unmet supportive service need by race/ethnicity and nativity highlight immigrants with lung cancer as being particularly underserved. Eliminating disparities in access to needed supportive services is essential for delivering patient-centered, equitable cancer care.},

Many patients experience severe, unnecessary symptoms during treatment as well as at the end of life. Often, patients receive `aggressive' care at the end of life that is discordant with their preferences. Palliative care is an approach that focuses on communication and quality of life, including treatment of physical, psychosocial, and spiritual suffering. This approach is appropriate for patients with life-limiting cancer, throughout the course of their disease. A growing body of evidence supports the integration of palliative care into routine cancer care, owing to the benefits in symptom control, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and resource utilization. Palliative care can be delivered in inpatient, outpatient, and home-based settings. The specialty and associated infrastructure is expanding rapidly with support from the international medical community. The ideal model of how to incorporate palliative care providers into the care of patients with cancer is yet to be defined; future research is needed to develop delivery systems and improve access to palliative care services. Through collaboration between oncologists and palliative care teams, there is hope of improving the quality of care for patients with both curable and life-limiting cancers.},

  abstract = {Background
The goal of the present study was to analyze associations between depression and mortality of cancer patients and to test whether these associations would vary by study characteristics.

Method
Meta-analysis was used for integrating the results of 105 samples derived from 76 prospective studies.

Results
Depression diagnosis and higher levels of depressive symptoms predicted elevated mortality. This was true in studies that assessed depression before cancer diagnosis as well as in studies that assessed depression following cancer diagnosis. Associations between depression and mortality persisted after controlling for confounding medical variables. The depression\textendash{}mortality association was weaker in studies that had longer intervals between assessments of depression and mortality, in younger samples and in studies that used the Beck Depression Inventory as compared with other depression scales.

Conclusions
Screening for depression should be routinely conducted in the cancer treatment setting. Referrals to mental health specialists should be considered. Research is needed on whether the treatment of depression could, beyond enhancing quality of life, extend survival of depressed cancer patients.},

  title = {Challenges in Clinical Natural Language Processing for Automated Disorder Normalization},
  volume = {57},
  issn = {15320464},
  abstract = {Background: Identifying key variables such as disorders within the clinical narratives in electronic health records has wide-ranging applications within clinical practice and biomedical research. Previous research has demonstrated reduced performance of disorder named entity recognition (NER) and normalization (or grounding) in clinical narratives than in biomedical publications. In this work, we aim to identify the cause for this performance difference and introduce general solutions.
Methods: We use closure properties to compare the richness of the vocabulary in clinical narrative text to biomedical publications. We approach both disorder NER and normalization using machine learning methodologies. Our NER methodology is based on linear-chain conditional random fields with a rich feature approach, and we introduce several improvements to enhance the lexical knowledge of the NER system. Our normalization method \textendash{} never previously applied to clinical data \textendash{} uses pairwise learning to rank to automatically learn term variation directly from the training data.
Results: We find that while the size of the overall vocabulary is similar between clinical narrative and biomedical publications, clinical narrative uses a richer terminology to describe disorders than publications. We apply our system, DNorm-C, to locate disorder mentions and in the clinical narratives from the recent ShARe/CLEF eHealth Task. For NER (strict span-only), our system achieves precision = 0.797, recall = 0.713, f-score = 0.753. For the normalization task (strict span + concept) it achieves precision = 0.712, recall = 0.637, f-score = 0.672. The improvements described in this article increase the NER f-score by 0.039 and the normalization f-score by 0.036. We also describe a high recall version of the NER, which increases the normalization recall to as high as 0.744, albeit with reduced precision. Discussion: We perform an error analysis, demonstrating that NER errors outnumber normalization errors by more than 4-to-1. Abbreviations and acronyms are found to be frequent causes of error, in addition to the mentions the annotators were not able to identify within the scope of the controlled vocabulary.
Conclusion: Disorder mentions in text from clinical narratives use a rich vocabulary that results in high term variation, which we believe to be one of the primary causes of reduced performance in clinical narrative. We show that pairwise learning to rank offers high performance in this context, and introduce several lexical enhancements \textendash{} generalizable to other clinical NER tasks \textendash{} that improve the ability of the NER system to handle this variation. DNorm-C is a high performing, open source system for disorders in clinical text, and a promising step toward NER and normalization methods that are trainable to a wide variety of domains and entities. (DNorm-C is open source software, and is available with a trained model at the DNorm demonstration website: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/tmTools/ \#DNorm.)},

  title = {Psychosocial Factors and Mortality in Women with Early Stage Endometrial Cancer},
  volume = {19},
  issn = {1359-107X},
  abstract = {Objectives
Psychosocial factors have previously been linked with survival and mortality in cancer populations. Little evidence is available about the relationship between these factors and outcomes in gynaecologic cancer populations, particularly endometrial cancer, the fourth most common cancer among women. This study examined the relationship between several psychosocial factors prior to surgical resection and risk of all-cause mortality in women with endometrial cancer.

Design
The study utilized a non-experimental, longitudinal design.

Methods
Participants were 87 women (Mage = 60.69 years, SDage = 9.12 years) who were diagnosed with T1N0\textendash{}T3N2 endometrial cancer and subsequently underwent surgery. Participants provided psychosocial data immediately prior to surgery. Survival statuses 4\textendash{}5 years post-diagnoses were abstracted via medical record review. Cox regression was employed for the survival analysis.

Results
Of the 87 women in this sample, 21 women died during the 4- to 5-year follow-up. Adjusting for age, presence of regional disease and medical comorbidity severity (known biomedical prognostic factors), greater use of an active coping style prior to surgery was significantly associated with a lower probability of all-cause mortality, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78, p = .04. Life stress, depressive symptoms, use of self-distraction coping, receipt of emotional support and endometrial cancer quality of life prior to surgery were not significantly associated with all-cause mortality 4\textendash{}5 years following diagnosis.

Conclusions
Greater use of active coping prior to surgery for suspected endometrial cancer is associated with lower probability of all-cause mortality 4\textendash{}5 years post-surgery. Future research should attempt to replicate these relationships in a larger and more representative sample and examine potential behavioural and neuroendocrine/immune mediators of this relationship.},

These models were generated from unstructured clinical notes taken from a national sample of U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) medical records. We created three matched cohorts: veterans who committed suicide, veterans who used mental health services and did not commit suicide, and veterans who did not use mental health services and did not commit suicide during the observation period (n = 70 in each group). From the clinical notes, we generated datasets of single keywords and multi-word phrases, and constructed prediction models using a machine-learning algorithm based on a genetic programming framework. The resulting inference accuracy was consistently 65\% or more. Our data therefore suggests that computerized text analytics can be applied to unstructured medical records to estimate the risk of suicide. The resulting system could allow clinicians to potentially screen seemingly healthy patients at the primary care level, and to continuously evaluate the suicide risk among psychiatric patients.},

  abstract = {Objectives. Therefore, the present study is examining associations of anxiety and depression in a large representative sample of patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
Methods. Patients (n \textonequarter{} 684) were routinely assessed for anxiety and depression with the PsychoSocial Screen for Cancer questionnaire after diagnosis of lung cancer and before treatment initiation between 2004 and 2010. Survival data were retrieved in May 2012. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses had been used as statistical procedures allowing adjustment for demographic, biomedical, and treatment variables.
Results. In analyses controlling for demographic, biomedical, and treatment prognosticators, anxiety but not depression was associated with increased lung cancerespecific (hazard ratio 1.04; 95\% confidence interval 1.01e1.07; P \textonequarter{} 0.035) and allcause (hazard ratio 1.04; 95\% confidence interval 1.01e1.07; P \textonequarter{} 0.005) mortality. Secondary analyses revealed a confounder effect of performance status on the association between depression and mortality, such that the removal of performance status identified a significant relationship of depression on lung cancerespecific and all-cause mortality.
Conclusion. In a large population-based sample of patients with nonesmall cell lung cancer analyses demonstrated associations of anxiety with mortality, adding to the evidence that psychosocial factors might play a role in disease progression in this patient group. Because emotional distress is associated with continued smoking and lack of success of smoking cessation attempts, psychological interventions potentially could influence length of survival in lung cancer patients.

  shorttitle = {Anxiety and Depression after Cancer Diagnosis},
  abstract = {Background: Reported prevalence of emotional distress in cancer patients varies widely across studies. The present study determined prevalence of anxiety and depression (separated for presence of symptoms versus clinical levels) in a large, representative sample of cancer patients after diagnosis.
Method: During the years 2004\textendash{}2009, 10,153 consecutive patients were routinely screened with the Psychosocial Screen for Cancer questionnaire at two major cancer centers.
Results: Patients' mean age was 59 years and 45\% were men. Across cancer types, 19.0\% of patients showed clinical levels of anxiety and another 22.6\% had subclinical symptoms. Further, 12.9\% of patients reported clinical symptoms of depression and an additional 16.5\% described subclinical symptoms. Analyses by cancer type revealed significant differences such that patients with lung, gynecological, or hematological cancer reported the highest levels of distress at the time point of cancer diagnosis. As expected, women showed higher rates of anxiety and depression, and for some cancer types the prevalence was two to three times higher than that seen for men. In some cancer types emotional distress was inversely related to age. Patients younger than 50 and women across all cancer types revealed either subclinical or clinical levels of anxiety in over 50\% of cases. Limitations: Findings describe levels of emotional distress after diagnosis but cannot inform about trajectories of anxiety and depression over time.
Conclusion: Given that levels of anxiety and depression varied widely by cancer type, gender, and age, these results inform which cancer patients are most likely in need of psychosocial support. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 439 cancer patients (61.2\% response) at a regional tertiary cancer center assessed patterns of support service utilization, cancer-specific distress, social support and constraints, and attitudes to help seeking. Results: Patients less frequently received advice about psychosocial support in comparison with treatment-related information. More than half the respondents were aware of social work support, support groups, and chaplain support; however, most did not utilize these services. For unaware patients, up to 47\% would have utilized support services if they had known of their existence. The use of services was significantly related to being female, younger, and having greater cancer-specific distress, more positive and less negative attitudes to help seeking. Future intention to contact a health professional for psychological support was predicted by more positive subjective norms and outcome expectations, higher cancer-specific distress, and less negative attitudes to help seeking. Conclusion: Initiatives that encourage distressed patients to use psychosocial care services should highlight positive outcomes.

  abstract = {20\textendash{}40\% of cancer patients show emotional distress. Psychosocial support should be offered to severely distressed patients. However, little is known about the selection of patients to whom such support should be offered. This study investigated oncologists' ability to identify such patients. In a consecutive series of 298 cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, distress, perceived social support and desire for supportive counselling were assessed using screening instruments. Simultaneously, 8 oncologists estimated patient distress and need for psychosocial support. A complete set of data was obtained in 80.2\% of cases. Concordance of the oncologists' estimation of patient distress and perceived social support with the results of the screening instruments was weak ({$\kappa$} = 0.10 and {$\kappa$} = 0.05). Oncologists recognized the presence of severe distress only in 11 of the 30 severely distressed patients. Correct perception of distress was lower in patients with head and neck cancer and lung cancer and in lower class patients. Oncologists' recommendations for supportive counselling did not correlate with patient distress or the amount of perceived support but rather with progressive disease and less denial behaviour. Our results underline the need for educating oncologists in order to improve their ability to identify patient distress. \textcopyright{} 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com},

  abstract = {Background This study examines the care needs of rehabilitating breast cancer survivors and determines what sociodemographic and medical characteristics are associated with these care needs. Methods A large-scale cross-sectional study (n = 465, response rate = 65\%) was conducted among survivors who had ended primary treatment less than 6 months previously. Questionnaires were completed regarding participants' care needs, how these needs were met and the time and manner preferred for receiving information and support. Care needs regarding seven specific rehabilitation topics were assessed separately: (1) physical functioning, (2) psychological functioning, (3) self and body image, (4) sexuality, (5) relationship with partner, (6) relationship with others, and (7) work, return to work and social security. Results High unmet needs were reported across all topics. The time preferred for receiving information and support across most topics was the period of breast cancer treatment. The most popular sources of information and support were informative brochures, consultation with a psychologist, information sessions and an informative website. Younger age and lower income were associated with care needs after treatment. Conclusions A valuable contribution is made to the literature on post-treatment care needs by comprehensively mapping unmet needs and the preferred time and source for meeting those needs. This study leads to greater awareness of the struggle facing breast cancer survivors and should guide those developing post-treatment interventions. As optimal tailoring to the needs of the target group is a prerequisite for success, preparatory needs assessment should be essential to the development of supportive interventions.

  issn = {1097-0142},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is considerable uncertainty regarding the acceptability of routine distress screening. METHODS: In an unfunded implementation study, the authors asked 50 clinicians (chemotherapy nurses and treatment radiographers/radiation technologists) to implement a screening program for distress as part of routine care and to record their feedback after each clinical encounter. In total, 379 patients were screened using a simple paper-and-pencil versions of distress thermometer and the emotion thermometer (ET). RESULTS: Across all screening applications, clinicians believed that screening was useful during 43\% of assessments and was not useful during 35.9\% of assessments, and they were unsure or neutral in 21.1\% of assessments. The application of the screening program assisted staff in changing their clinical opinion after 41.9\% of assessments, and clinicians believed that the screening program helped with communication in {$>$}50\% of assessments. However, 37.5\% believed that screening was impractical for routine use, and more chemotherapy nurses than radiographers rated the screening program as ``not useful.'' On multivariate analysis, 3 variables were associated with high staff satisfaction with screening, namely, receipt of prior training, talking with the patient about psychosocial issues, and improved detection of psychological problems. A favorable perception of screening also was linked to a change in clinical opinion. CONCLUSIONS: Opinions of cancer clinicians regarding routine distress screening were mixed: Approximately 33\% considered screening not useful/impractical, whereas {$>$}50\%n believed promoted good communication and/or helped with recognition. Clinicians who were more positive about screening gained greater benefits from screening in terms of communication and recognition. Cancer 2012. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Cancer Society.},

A non-randomized clinical trial was conducted, comparing outcomes before and after the integration of an interdisciplinary CST in routine care of adults with Stage III or IV lung, gastrointestinal or gynecologic cancer. In the control arm, patients (n=332) received usual care; following initiation of the intervention arm, eligible patients (n=278) received the CST intervention. The intervention consisted of individualized care coordination, symptom management, education, psychosocial and spiritual support, and advance care planning throughout the 15-month study period. Quality of end-of-life care was measured through an ``aggressiveness of care'' index. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy\textendash{}General (FACT-G).

Results
There were no statistically significant differences between groups on specific indicators of quality of care. Surviving subjects with higher survival expectancy (who also reported better baseline quality of life) in the intervention arm had the greatest improvement in HRQOL scores, compared with the other three groupings of survival expectancy by treatment group (high vs. low by intervention vs. control) (P=0.044).

Conclusion
Individually tailored supportive services from an interdisciplinary team are associated with improved HRQOL in some patients. This has implications for the potential benefits that can be accrued from providing intensive support to all patients, even those who may appear to be at less risk for distress. There also are important methodological considerations in using aggressiveness of care indices as a measure of quality of care.},

  abstract = {Context
There are few randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of palliative care.

Objective
To determine the effect of a palliative care intervention on quality of life (QOL), symptom intensity, mood, and resource utilization.

Design, Setting, and Participants
Randomized controlled trial (November 2003-May 2008) of 322 patients with advanced cancer and an identified caregiver in a rural, NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center (the Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Lebanon, NH) and affiliated outreach clinics and Veteran's Affairs Medical Center (White River Junction, VT).

Intervention
A multi-component, psycho-educational, palliative care intervention (Project ENABLE) conducted by an advanced practice nurse consisting of 4 weekly educational sessions and monthly follow-up until death or study completion.

Main Outcome Measures
(1) The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative (range: 0 to 184; higher scores indicate better QOL), (2) Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (range: 0 to 900; higher scores indicate greater symptom intensity), (3) Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (range: 0 to 60; higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms), completed at baseline, 1 month and every 3 months until death or study completion, (4) days in hospital, intensive care unit (ICU), and emergency department visits recorded in the medical record.

Results
322 participants with gastrointestinal (41\%), lung (36\%), genitourinary (12\%), and breast (10\%) cancer were randomized. Estimated treatment effects (intervention minus usual care) for all subjects were 4.6 (P = .02) for QOL, -27.8 (P = .06) for symptom intensity, and -1.8 (P = .02) for depressed mood. Estimated average treatment effects in the sample of participants who died during the study were 8.6 (P = .02) for QOL, -24.2 (P = .24) for symptom intensity, and -2.7 (P = .03) for depressed mood. Days in hospital, intensive care unit, and emergency department visits were not different between groups.

Conclusions
Compared to participants receiving usual oncology care, participants receiving a palliative care intervention addressing physical, psychosocial, and care coordination provided concurrently with oncology care had higher QOL and mood; comparisons of symptom intensity and days in hospital, ICU, and emergency department visits were not statistically significant.

  shorttitle = {Effects and Moderators of Psychosocial Interventions on Quality of Life, and Emotional and Social Function in Patients with Cancer},
  abstract = {Objective
This individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of psychosocial interventions (PSI) on quality of life (QoL), emotional function (EF), and social function (SF) in patients with cancer, and to study moderator effects of demographic, clinical, personal, and intervention-related characteristics.

Methods
Relevant studies were identified via literature searches in 4 databases. We pooled IPD from 22 (n~=~4217) of 61 eligible randomized controlled trials. Linear mixed-effect model analyses were used to study intervention effects on the post-intervention values of QoL, EF, and SF (z-scores), adjusting for baseline values, age, and cancer type. We studied moderator effects by testing interactions with the intervention for demographic, clinical, personal, and intervention-related characteristics, and conducted subsequent stratified analyses for significant moderator variables.Results: PSI significantly improved QoL ({$\beta{}~$}=~0.14,95\%CI~=~0.06;0.21), EF ({$\beta{}~$}=~0.13,95\%CI~=~0.05;0.20), and SF ({$\beta{}~$}=~0.10,95\%CI~=~0.03;0.18). Significant differences in effects of different types of PSI were found, with largest effects of psychotherapy. The effects of coping skills training were moderated by age, treatment type, and targeted interventions. Effects of psychotherapy on EF may be moderated by cancer type, but these analyses were based on 2 randomized controlled trials with small sample sizes of some cancer types.

Conclusions
PSI significantly improved QoL, EF, and SF, with small overall effects. However, the effects differed by several demographic, clinical, personal, and intervention-related characteristics. Our study highlights the beneficial effects of coping skills training in patients treated with chemotherapy, the importance of targeted interventions, and the need of developing interventions tailored to the specific needs of elderly patients.},

  abstract = {Background Electronic medical records (EMRs) are revolutionizing health-related research. One key issue for study quality is the accurate identification of patients with the condition of interest. Information in EMRs can be entered as structured codes or unstructured free text. The majority of research studies have used only coded parts of EMRs for case-detection, which may bias findings, miss cases, and reduce study quality. This review examines whether incorporating information from text into case-detection algorithms can improve research quality.
Methods A systematic search returned 9659 papers, 67 of which reported on the extraction of information from free text of EMRs with the stated purpose of detecting cases of a named clinical condition. Methods for extracting information from text and the technical accuracy of case-detection algorithms were reviewed.
Results Studies mainly used US hospital-based EMRs, and extracted information from text for 41 conditions using keyword searches, rule-based algorithms, and machine learning methods. There was no clear difference in case-detection algorithm accuracy between rule-based and machine learning methods of extraction. Inclusion of information from text resulted in a significant improvement in algorithm sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic in comparison to codes alone (median sensitivity 78\% (codes {\th} text) vs 62\% (codes), P \textonequarter{} .03; median area under the receiver operating characteristic 95\% (codes {\th} text) vs 88\% (codes), P \textonequarter{} .025).
Conclusions Text in EMRs is accessible, especially with open source information extraction algorithms, and significantly improves case detection when combined with codes. More harmonization of reporting within EMR studies is needed, particularly standardized reporting of algorithm accuracy metrics like positive predictive value (precision) and sensitivity (recall).},

  abstract = {Background\hspace{0.6em} We report a study of machine learning applied to the phenotyping of psychiatric diagnosis for research recruitment in youth depression, conducted with 861 labelled electronic medical records (EMRs) documents. A model was built that could accurately identify individuals who were suitable candidates for a study on youth depression.
Objective\hspace{0.6em} Our objective was a model to identify individuals who meet inclusion criteria as well as unsuitable patients who would require exclusion.
Methods\hspace{0.6em} Our methods included applying a system that coded the EMR documents by removing personally identifying information, using two psychiatrists who labelled a set of EMR documents (from which the 861 came), using a brute force search and training a deep neural network for this task. Findings\hspace{0.6em} According to a cross-validation evaluation, we describe a model that had a specificity of 97\% and a sensitivity of 45\% and a second model with a specificity of 53\% and a sensitivity of 89\%. We combined these two models into a third one (sensitivity 93.5\%; specificity 68\%; positive predictive value (precision) 77\%) to generate a list of most suitable candidates in support of research recruitment.
Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Our efforts are meant to demonstrate the potential for this type of approach for patient recruitment purposes but it should be noted that a larger sample size is required to build a truly reliable recommendation system. Clinical implications\hspace{0.6em} Future efforts will employ alternate neural network algorithms available and other machine learning methods.},

  abstract = {Working with military veterans poses significant challenges for therapists. Among the most notable are learning to appreciate military culture, understanding military vernacular, and engaging veterans who have experienced Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this project was to explore veterans' use of metaphor in describing experiences of PTSD and to consider the therapeutic value of metaphor for mental health practitioners. Using a secondary data analysis design, 359 online video interview segments of 57 veterans were reviewed with respect to the way that metaphor was used to describe experiences of PTSD. The metaphors identified in the secondary data were analyzed inductively and deductively by deriving themes from the metaphors that veterans used and associating them to conceptual themes identified in the literature on military culture. The findings indicate that veterans make use of metaphor to describe how PTSD once dominated their life, how they came to manage their PTSD symptoms, and how they used their experience of PTSD to promote a survivor's mission. The findings also suggest that the metaphors that veterans use can also be associated with the conceptual themes identified in the research. These findings underscore the value of using metaphor in therapy with veterans who have PTSD as metaphor has been shown to facilitate cultural accommodation, symptom mitigation, and narrative integration.},

  abstract = {The ability to predict psychiatric readmission would facilitate the development of interventions to reduce this risk, a major driver of psychiatric health-care costs. The symptoms or characteristics of illness course necessary to develop reliable predictors are not available in coded billing data, but may be present in narrative electronic health record (EHR) discharge summaries. We identified a cohort of individuals admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 1994 and 2012 with a principal diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and extracted inpatient psychiatric discharge narrative notes. Using these data, we trained a 75-topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a form of natural language processing, which identifies groups of words associated with topics discussed in a document collection. The cohort was randomly split to derive a training (70\%) and testing (30\%) data set, and we trained separate support vector machine models for baseline clinical features alone, baseline features plus common individual words and the above plus topics identified from the 75-topic LDA model. Of 4687 patients with inpatient discharge summaries, 470 were readmitted within 30 days. The 75-topic LDA model included topics linked to psychiatric symptoms (suicide, severe depression, anxiety, trauma, eating/weight and panic) and major depressive disorder comorbidities (infection, postpartum, brain tumor, diarrhea and pulmonary disease). By including LDA topics, prediction of readmission, as measured by area under receiver-operating characteristic curves in the testing data set, was improved from baseline (area under the curve 0.618) to baseline+1000 words (0.682) to baseline+75 topics (0.784). Inclusion of topics derived from narrative notes allows more accurate discrimination of individuals at high risk for psychiatric readmission in this cohort. Topic modeling and related approaches offer the potential to improve prediction using EHRs, if generalizability can be established in other clinical cohorts.},

We extended the work in predictive modeling of treatment resistant depression (TRD) via partition of the data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) cohort into a training and a testing dataset. We also included data from a small yet completely independent cohort RIS-INT-93 as an external test dataset. We used features from enrollment and level 1 treatment (up to week 2 response only) of STAR*D to explore the feature space comprehensively and applied machine learning methods to model TRD outcome at level 2. For TRD defined using QIDS-C16 remission criteria, multiple machine learning models were internally cross-validated in the STAR*D training dataset and externally validated in both the STAR*D testing dataset and RIS-INT-93 independent dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.70\textendash{}0.78 and 0.72\textendash{}0.77, respectively. The upper bound for the AUC achievable with the full set of features could be as high as 0.78 in the STAR*D testing dataset. Model developed using top 30 features identified using feature selection technique (k-means clustering followed by {$\chi$}2 test) achieved an AUC of 0.77 in the STAR*D testing dataset. In addition, the model developed using overlapping features between STAR*D and RIS-INT-93, achieved an AUC of {$>$} 0.70 in both the STAR*D testing and RIS-INT-93 datasets. Among all the features explored in STAR*D and RIS-INT-93 datasets, the most important feature was early or initial treatment response or symptom severity at week 2. These results indicate that prediction of TRD prior to undergoing a second round of antidepressant treatment could be feasible even in the absence of biomarker data.},

  abstract = {The outcome of treatment with antidepressants varies markedly across people with the same diagnosis. A clinically significant prediction of outcomes could spare the frustration of trial and error approach and improve the outcomes of major depressive disorder through individualized treatment selection. It is likely that a combination of multiple predictors is needed to achieve such prediction. We used elastic net regularized regression to optimize prediction of symptom improvement and remission during treatment with escitalopram or nortriptyline and to identify contributing predictors from a range of demographic and clinical variables in 793 adults with major depressive disorder. A combination of demographic and clinical variables, with strong contributions from symptoms of depressed mood, reduced interest, decreased activity, indecisiveness, pessimism and anxiety significantly predicted treatment outcomes, explaining 5e10\% of variance in symptom improvement with escitalopram. Similar combinations of variables predicted remission with area under the curve 0.72, explaining approximately 15\% of variance (pseudo R2) in who achieves remission, with strong contributions from body mass index, appetite, interest-activity symptom dimension and anxious-somatizing depression subtype. Escitalopram-specific outcome prediction was more accurate than generic outcome prediction, and reached effect sizes that were near or above a previously established benchmark for clinical significance. Outcome prediction on the nortriptyline arm did not significantly differ from chance. These results suggest that easily obtained demographic and clinical variables can predict therapeutic response to escitalopram with clinically meaningful accuracy, suggesting a potential for individualized prescription of this antidepressant drug. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Objective Currently, depression diagnosis relies primarily on behavioral symptoms and signs, and treatment is guided by trial and error instead of evaluating associated underlying brain characteristics. Unlike past studies, we attempted to estimate accurate prediction models for late-life depression diagnosis and treatment response using multiple machine learning methods with inputs of multi-modal imaging and non-imaging whole brain and network-based features. Methods Late-life depression patients (medicated post-recruitment) (n = 33) and older non-depressed individuals (n = 35) were recruited. Their demographics and cognitive ability scores were recorded, and brain characteristics were acquired using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging pretreatment. Linear and nonlinear learning methods were tested for estimating accurate prediction models. Results A learning method called alternating decision trees estimated the most accurate prediction models for late-life depression diagnosis (87.27\% accuracy) and treatment response (89.47\% accuracy). The diagnosis model included measures of age, Mini-mental state examination score, and structural imaging (e.g. whole brain atrophy and global white mater hyperintensity burden). The treatment response model included measures of structural and functional connectivity. Conclusions Combinations of multi-modal imaging and/or non-imaging measures may help better predict late-life depression diagnosis and treatment response. As a preliminary observation, we speculate that the results may also suggest that different underlying brain characteristics defined by multi-modal imaging measures\textemdash{}rather than region-based differences\textemdash{}are associated with depression versus depression recovery because to our knowledge this is the first depression study to accurately predict both using the same approach. These findings may help better understand late-life depression and identify preliminary steps toward personalized late-life depression treatment.

  volume = {74},
  issn = {0006-3223},
  abstract = {Background
Early identification of depressed individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be helpful in selecting optimal setting and intensity of care. At present, validated tools to facilitate this risk stratification are rarely used in psychiatric practice.
Methods
Data were drawn from the first two treatment levels of a multicenter antidepressant effectiveness study in major depressive disorder, the STAR⁎D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) cohort. This cohort was divided into training, testing, and validation subsets. Only clinical or sociodemographic variables available by or readily amenable to self-report were considered. Multivariate models were developed to discriminate individuals reaching remission with a first or second pharmacological treatment trial from those not reaching remission despite two trials.
Results
A logistic regression model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve exceeding .71 in training, testing, and validation cohorts and maintained good calibration across cohorts. Performance of three alternative models with machine learning approaches\textemdash{}a na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier and a support vector machine, and a random forest model\textemdash{}was less consistent. Similar performance was observed between more and less severe depression, men and women, and primary versus specialty care sites. A web-based calculator was developed that implements this tool and provides graphical estimates of risk.
Conclusion
Risk for treatment resistance among outpatients with major depressive disorder can be estimated with a simple model incorporating baseline sociodemographic and clinical features. Future studies should examine the performance of this model in other clinical populations and its utility in treatment selection or clinical trial design.},

  shorttitle = {Depression Symptom Dimensions as Predictors of Antidepressant Treatment Outcome},
  abstract = {Background. Symptom dimensions have not yet been comprehensively tested as predictors of the substantial heterogeneity in outcomes of antidepressant treatment in major depressive disorder.
Method. We tested nine symptom dimensions derived from a previously published factor analysis of depression rating scales as predictors of outcome in 811 adults with moderate to severe depression treated with flexibly dosed escitalopram or nortriptyline in Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP). The effects of symptom dimensions were tested in mixed-effect regression models that controlled for overall initial depression severity, age, sex and recruitment centre. Significant results were tested for replicability in 3637 adult out-patients with non-psychotic major depression treated with citalopram in level I of Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D).
Results. The interest-activity symptom dimension (reflecting low interest, reduced activity, indecisiveness and lack of enjoyment) at baseline strongly predicted poor treatment outcome in GENDEP, irrespective of overall depression severity, antidepressant type and outcome measure used. The prediction of poor treatment outcome by the interestactivity dimension was robustly replicated in STAR*D, independent of a comprehensive list of baseline covariates.
Conclusions. Loss of interest, diminished activity and inability to make decisions predict poor outcome of antidepressant treatment even after adjustment for overall depression severity and other clinical covariates. The prominence of such symptoms may require additional treatment strategies and should be accounted for in future investigations of antidepressant response.},

  abstract = {Symptoms of depression are present in over half of all cancer patients, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) anti-depressant medications are prescribed to nearly a quarter of these individuals in order to cope with their disease. Previous studies have provided evidence that elevated serotonin (5-HT) and serotonin receptor levels may contribute to oncogenic progression, yet little is known regarding the mechanism by which this occurs. The data demonstrated that serotonin receptor mRNAs and proteins are expressed across diverse cancer types, and that serotonin stimulation of tumor cells activates oncogenic signaling mediators including components of the AKT, CREB, GSK3, and MAPK pathways. Selective pharmacological inhibition of the seven known classes of 5-HT receptors in sarcoma and breast cancer cells resulted in dose dependent decreases in tumor cell viability, activation of the p53 DNA damage pathway, suppression of MAPK activity, and significantly reduced tumor volume in an in ovo model. Based on a retrospective clinical analysis of 419 patients diagnosed with breast cancer, we discovered that use of SSRIs was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in tumor proliferation rates for late stage patients based on their Ki-67 index (P=0.03). These data provide evidence that serotonin signaling pathways, which treating oncologists often pharmacologically target to assist cancer patients to psychologically cope with their illness, activate signaling pathways known to promote tumor growth and survival.},

  abstract = {Background Although the detrimental impact of major depressive disorder (MDD) at the individual level has been described, its global epidemiology remains unclear given limitations in the data. Here we present the modelled epidemiological profile of MDD dealing with heterogeneity in the data, enforcing internal consistency between epidemiological parameters and making estimates for world regions with no empirical data. These estimates were used to quantify the burden of MDD for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010). Method Analyses drew on data from our existing literature review of the epidemiology of MDD. DisMod-MR, the latest version of the generic disease modelling system redesigned as a Bayesian meta-regression tool, derived prevalence by age, year and sex for 21 regions. Prior epidemiological knowledge, study- and country-level covariates adjusted sub-optimal raw data. Results There were over 298 million cases of MDD globally at any point in time in 2010, with the highest proportion of cases occurring between 25 and 34 years. Global point prevalence was very similar across time (4.4\% (95\% uncertainty: 4.2\textendash{}4.7\%) in 1990, 4.4\% (4.1\textendash{}4.7\%) in 2005 and 2010), but higher in females (5.5\% (5.0\textendash{}6.0\%) compared to males (3.2\% (3.0\textendash{}3.6\%) in 2010. Regions in conflict had higher prevalence than those with no conflict. The annual incidence of an episode of MDD followed a similar age and regional pattern to prevalence but was about one and a half times higher, consistent with an average duration of 37.7 weeks. Conclusion We were able to integrate available data, including those from high quality surveys and sub-optimal studies, into a model adjusting for known methodological sources of heterogeneity. We were also able to estimate the epidemiology of MDD in regions with no available data. This informed GBD 2010 and the public health field, with a clearer understanding of the global distribution of MDD.},

  abstract = {Background: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) are scales used frequently to rate the symptoms of depression. There are many situations in which it is important to know what a given total score or a percent reduction from baseline score of one scale means in relation to the other scale.
Method: We used the equipercentile linking method to identify corresponding scores of simultaneous HAM-D and MADRS ratings in 4388 patients from 31 mirtazapine trials in major depressive disorder. Data were collected at baseline and at weeks 1, 2 and 4.
Results: HAM-D scores of 10, 20, 30 and 40 roughly corresponded to MADRS scores of 13, 26, 39 and 52\textendash{}53, respectively. An absolute HAM-D improvement of 10, 20, 25 points corresponded to a MADRS improvement of 12, 26, and 34. A percentage improvement from baseline of the HAM-D was approximately the same as a percentage improvement on the MADRS.
Conclusion: These results are important for the comparison of trials that used the HAM-D and MADRS. We present conversion tables for future research.},

  shorttitle = {Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Therapeutic Outcomes in Depression},
  abstract = {Background
No previous study has comprehensively reviewed the application of machine learning algorithms in mood disorders populations. Herein, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate previous studies of machine learning-devised models that predict therapeutic outcomes in mood disorders populations.
Methods
We searched Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed from inception to February 8, 2018 for relevant studies that included adults with bipolar or unipolar depression; assessed therapeutic outcomes with a pharmacological, neuromodulatory, or manual-based psychotherapeutic intervention for depression; applied a machine learning algorithm; and reported predictors of therapeutic response. A random-effects meta-analysis of proportions and meta-regression analyses were conducted.
Results
We identified 639 records: 75 full-text publications were assessed for eligibility; 26 studies (n=17,499) and 20 studies (n=6325) were included in qualitative and quantitative review, respectively. Classification algorithms were able to predict therapeutic outcomes with an overall accuracy of 0.82 (95\% confidence interval [CI] of [0.77, 0.87]). Pooled estimates of classification accuracy were significantly greater (p {$<$} 0.01) in models informed by multiple data types (e.g., composite of phenomenological patient features and neuroimaging or peripheral gene expression data; pooled proportion [95\% CI] = 0.93[0.86, 0.97]) when compared to models with lower-dimension data types (pooledproportion=0.68[0.62,0.74]to0.85[0.81,0.88]).
Limitations
Most studies were retrospective; differences in machine learning algorithms and their implementation (e.g., cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning); cannot infer importance of individual variables fed into learning algorithm.
Conclusions
Machine learning algorithms provide a powerful conceptual and analytic framework capable of integrating multiple data types and sources. An integrative approach may more effectively model neurobiological components as functional modules of pathophysiology embedded within the complex, social dynamics that influence the phenomenology of mental disorders.},

  abstract = {Background
The ability to convert total scores from one scale to another facilitates the interpretation of research findings and facilitates the use of systematic measurement in clinical practice.

Methods
Item Response Theory methods were used to convert total scores between the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16) and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores. Data were obtained from a sample of 233 outpatients with highly treatment-resistant, nonpsychotic major depressive episodes participating in a one-year open label study of vagus nerve stimulation to augment psychotropic medication treatment.

Results
MADRS total scores averaged 31.9 (SD=6.7) at baseline and 21.9 (SD=11.0) at one year. QIDS-SR16 total scores averaged 17.6 (SD=3.6) at baseline and 12.5 (SD=5.8) at one year. Based on one-year data (or exit if the patient did not complete one year), corresponding QIDS-SR16 and MADRS total scores were presented for each possible QIDS-SR16 and MADRS total score. A QIDS-SR16 total score of 5 was comparable to a MADRS total score of 7 or 8 (7.5).

Limitation
The degree to which these results generalize to less treatment-resistant samples is unknown.

Conclusion
The conversion of QIDS-SR16 and MADRS total scores provides a basis for clinicians who wish to use the QIDS-SR16 to understand what MADRS total scores reported in clinical trials approximate QIDS-SR16 total scores obtained with their patients.},

  abstract = {Background There are many prognostic factors for treatment outcome in major depressive disorder (MDD). The predictive power of any single factor, however, is limited. We aimed to develop profiles of antidepressant response and remission based upon hierarchical combinations of baseline clinical and demographic factors. Methods Using data from Level 1 of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (STAR*D), in which 2,876 participants with MDD were treated with citalopram, a signal-detection analysis was performed to identify hierarchical predictive profiles for patients with different treatment outcome. An automated algorithm was used to determine the optimal predictive variables by evaluating sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and test efficiency. Results Hierarchical combinations of baseline clinical and demographic factors yielded profiles that significantly predicted treatment outcome. In contrast to an overall 47\% response rate in STAR*D Level 1, response rates of profiled patient subgroups ranged from 31 to 63\%. In contrast to an overall remission rate of 28\%, identified subsets of patients had a 12 to 55\% probability of remission. The predictors of antidepressant treatment outcome most commonly incorporated into profiles were related to socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education), whereas indicators of depressive symptom type and severity, as well as comorbid clinical conditions, were useful but less powerful predictors. Conclusions Hierarchical profiles of demographic and clinical baseline variables categorized patients according to the likelihood they would benefit from a single antidepressant trial. Socioeconomic factors had greater predictive power than symptoms or other clinical factors, and profiles combining multiple factors were stronger predictors than individual factors alone.},

  abstract = {Background We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to identify subsets of patients with qualitatively distinct symptom trajectories resulting from treatment. Existing studies have focused on 12-week antidepressant trials. We used data from a concurrent antidepressant and psychotherapy trial over a 6-month period. Method Eight hundred twenty-one patients were randomized to receive either fluoxetine or tianepine and received cognitive-behavioral therapy, supportive therapy, or psychodynamic therapy. Patients completed the Montgomery\textendash{\AA}sberg depression rating scale (MADRS) at the 0, 1, 3, and 6-month periods. Patients also completed measures of dysfunctional attitudes, functioning, and personality. GMM was conducted using MADRS scores and the number of growth classes to be retained was based on the Bayesian information criterion. Results Criteria supported the presence of four distinct latent growth classes representing gradual responders of high severity (42\% of sample), gradual responders of moderate severity (31\%), nonresponders (15\%), and rapid responders (11\%). Initial severity, greater use of emotional coping strategies, less use of avoidance coping strategies, introversion, and less emotional stability predicted nonresponder status. Growth classes were not associated with different treatments or with proportion of dropouts. Conclusions The longer time period used in this study highlights potential overestimates of nonresponders in previous research and the need for continued assessments. Our findings demonstrate distinct growth trajectories that are independent of treatment modality and generalizable to most psychotherapy patients. The correlates of class membership provide directions for future studies, which can refine methods to predict likely nonresponders as a means to facilitate personalized treatments.},

Antidepressant response in mood disorders is a typical complex phenomenon were a number of predictors influence outcome under non-linear interactions. In the present study we tested a neural network strategy for antidepressant outcome in subjects affected by major depression. One hundred and forty-five never reported depressed inpatients were included in this study (major depressives/bipolars: 111/34). A multi layer perceptron network composed of 1 hidden layer with 13 nodes was chosen. The network was performed on the sample of 145 cases divided as follows: train 73+verify 36+test 36. Correlation of predicted versus observed response was 0.46 in the test (independent) sample that corresponds to 21\% of variance explained. Number of episodes, side effects, delusional features, baseline HAM-D, length of current episode, lithium augmentation, current medical condition and personality disorders were the main factors identified by the model. Sex, age at onset, polarity, plasma level and baseline VAS score were part of the model but with a lower rank. Overall, our findings suggest that neural networks could be a valid technique for the analysis of psychopharmacology studies. The complex interactions modelled through ANN may be eventually applied at the clinical level for the individualized therapy.},

  abstract = {The outcome of treatment with antidepressants varies markedly across people with the same diagnosis. A clinically significant prediction of outcomes could spare the frustration of trial and error approach and improve the outcomes of major depressive disorder through individualized treatment selection. It is likely that a combination of multiple predictors is needed to achieve such prediction. We used elastic net regularized regression to optimize prediction of symptom improvement and remission during treatment with escitalopram or nortriptyline and to identify contributing predictors from a range of demographic and clinical variables in 793 adults with major depressive disorder. A combination of demographic and clinical variables, with strong contributions from symptoms of depressed mood, reduced interest, decreased activity, indecisiveness, pessimism and anxiety significantly predicted treatment outcomes, explaining 5\textendash{}10\% of variance in symptom improvement with escitalopram. Similar combinations of variables predicted remission with area under the curve 0.72, explaining approximately 15\% of variance (pseudo R2) in who achieves remission, with strong contributions from body mass index, appetite, interest-activity symptom dimension and anxious-somatizing depression subtype. Escitalopram-specific outcome prediction was more accurate than generic outcome prediction, and reached effect sizes that were near or above a previously established benchmark for clinical significance. Outcome prediction on the nortriptyline arm did not significantly differ from chance. These results suggest that easily obtained demographic and clinical variables can predict therapeutic response to escitalopram with clinically meaningful accuracy, suggesting a potential for individualized prescription of this antidepressant drug.},

The study compares various treatment options for those who do not attain a satisfactory response with citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant. The study enrolls 4000 adults (ages 18\textendash{}75) from both primary and specialty care practices who have not had either a prior inadequate response or clear-cut intolerance to a robust trial of protocol treatments during the current major depressive episode. After receiving citalopram (level 1), participants without sufficient symptomatic benefit are eligible for randomization to level 2 treatments, which entail four switch options (sertraline, bupropion, venlafaxine, cognitive therapy) and three citalopram augment options (bupropion, buspirone, cognitive therapy). Those who receive cognitive therapy (switch or augment options) at level 2 without sufficient improvement are eligible for randomization to one of two level 2A switch options (venlafaxine or bupropion). Level 2 and 2A participants without sufficient improvement are eligible for random assignment to two switch options (mirtazapine or nortriptyline) and to two augment options (lithium or thyroid hormone) added to the primary antidepressant (citalopram, bupropion, sertraline, or venlafaxine) (level 3). Those without sufficient improvement at level 3 are eligible for level 4 random assignment to one of two switch options (tranylcypromine or the combination of mirtazapine and venlafaxine). The primary outcome is the clinician-rated, 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, administered at entry and exit from each treatment level through telephone interviews by assessors masked to treatment assignments. Secondary outcomes include self-reported depressive symptoms, physical and mental function, side-effect burden, client satisfaction, and health care utilization and cost. Participants with an adequate symptomatic response may enter the 12-month naturalistic follow-up phase with brief monthly and more complete quarterly assessments.},

  abstract = {The recent questioning of the antidepressant effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is partly based on the observation that approximately half of company-sponsored trials have failed to reveal a significant difference between active drug and placebo. Most of these have applied the Hamilton depression rating scale to assess symptom severity, the sum score for its 17 items (HDRS-17-sum) serving as effect parameter. In this study, we examined whether the negative outcomes of many SSRI trials may be partly caused by the use of this frequently questioned measure of response. We undertook patient-level post-hoc analyses of 18 industry-sponsored placebo-controlled trials regarding paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline or fluoxetine, and including in total 6669 adults with major depression, the aim being to assess what the outcome would have been if the single item depressed mood (rated 0\textendash{}4) had been used as a measure of efficacy. In total, 32 drug-placebo comparisons were reassessed. While 18 out of 32 comparisons (56\%) failed to separate active drug from placebo at week 6 with respect to reduction in HDRS-17-sum, only 3 out of 32 comparisons (9\%) were negative when depressed mood was used as an effect parameter (P{$<$}0.001). The observation that 29 out of 32 comparisons detected an antidepressant signal from the tested SSRI suggests the effect of these drugs to be more consistent across trials than previously assumed. Further, the frequent use of the HDRS-17-sum as an effect parameter may have distorted the current view on the usefulness of SSRIs and hampered the development of novel antidepressants.},

We expect that these embeddings will be useful across medical informatics for tasks such as cohort selection and patient summarization. These embeddings are learned using a technique called neural language modeling from the natural language processing community. However, rather than learning the embeddings solely from text, we show how to learn the embeddings from claims data, which is widely available both to providers and to payers. We also show that with a simple algorithmic adjustment, it is possible to learn medical concept embeddings in a privacy preserving manner from co-occurrence counts derived from clinical narratives. Finally, we establish a methodological framework, arising from standard medical ontologies such as UMLS, NDF-RT, and CCS, to further investigate the embeddings and precisely characterize their quantitative properties.},

This model is employed for the task of measuring semantic similarity between medical concepts, a task that is central to a number of techniques in medical informatics and information retrieval. The model is built with two medical corpora (journal abstracts and patient records) and empirically validated on two ground-truth datasets of human-judged concept pairs assessed by medical professionals. Empirically, our approach correlates closely with expert human assessors ({$\approx$}0.9) and outperforms a number of state-of-the-art benchmarks for medical semantic similarity. The demonstrated superiority of this model for providing an effective semantic similarity measure is promising in that this may translate into effectiveness gains for techniques in medical information retrieval and medical informatics (e.g., query expansion and literature-based discovery).},

Information concerning psychiatric symptoms is critical for the timely diagnosis of mental disorders, as well as for the personalization of interventions. However, the diversity and sparsity of psychiatric symptoms make it challenging for conventional natural language processing techniques to automatically extract such information from clinical text. To address this problem, this study takes the initiative to use and adapt word embeddings from four source domains \textendash{} intensive care, biomedical literature, Wikipedia and Psychiatric Forum \textendash{} to recognize symptoms in the target domain of psychiatry. We investigated four different approaches including 1) only using word embeddings of the source domain, 2) directly combining data of the source and target to generate word embeddings, 3) assigning different weights to word embeddings, and 4) retraining the word embedding model of the source domain using a corpus of the target domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of adapting multiple word embeddings of external domains to improve psychiatric symptom recognition in clinical text. Experimental results showed that the last two approaches outperformed the baseline methods, indicating the effectiveness of our new strategies to leverage embeddings from other domains.},

Domain adaptation (DA) is a technology that enables learning from annotated datasets from different sources, thereby reducing annotation cost required for ML training in the target domain. In this study, we investigate the use of DA methods for deidentification of psychiatric notes. Three state-of-the-art DA methods: instance pruning, instance weighting, and feature augmentation are applied to three source corpora of annotated hospital discharge summaries, outpatient notes, and a mixture of different note types written for diabetic patients. Our results show that DA can increase deidentification performance over the baselines, indicating that it can effectively reduce annotation cost for the target psychiatric notes. Feature augmentation is shown to increase performance the most among the three DA methods. Performance variation among the different types of clinical notes is also observed, showing that a mixture of different types of notes brings the biggest increase in performance.},

  abstract = {Importance: Suicide represents the 10th leading cause of death across age groups in the United States (12.6 cases per 100 000) and remains challenging to predict. While many individuals who die by suicide are seen by physicians before their attempt, they may not seek psychiatric care.
Objective: To determine the extent to which incorporating natural language processing of narrative discharge notes improves stratification of risk for death by suicide after medical or surgical hospital discharge.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective health care use study, clinical data were analyzed from individuals with discharges from 2 large academic medical centers between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was suicide as a reported cause of death based on Massachusetts Department of Public Health records. Regression models for prediction of death by suicide or accidental death were compared relying solely on coded clinical data and those using natural language processing of hospital discharge notes.
Results: There were 845 417 hospital discharges represented in the cohort, including 458 053 unique individuals. Overall, all-cause mortality was 18\% during 9 years, and the median follow-up was 5.2 years. The cohort included 235 (0.1\%) who died by suicide during 2.4 million patient-years of follow-up. Positive valence reflected in narrative notes was associated with a 30\% reduction in risk for suicide in models adjusted for coded sociodemographic and clinical features (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.58-0.85; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and improved model fit ({$\chi$}22\,=\,14.843, P\,{$<$}\,.001 by log-likelihood test). The C statistic was 0.741 (95\% CI, 0.738-0.744) for models of suicide with or without inclusion of accidental death.
Conclusions and Relevance: Multiple clinical features available at hospital discharge identified a cohort of individuals at substantially increased risk for suicide. Greater positive valence expressed in narrative discharge summaries was associated with substantially diminished risk. Automated tools to aid clinicians in evaluating these risks may assist in identifying high-risk individuals.},

In this paper, we present a method that retrofits distributional context vector representations of biomedical concepts using structural information from the UMLS Metathesaurus, such that the similarity between vector representations of linked concepts is augmented. We evaluated it on the UMNSRS benchmark. Our results demonstrate that retrofitting of concept vector representations leads to better correlation with human raters for both similarity and relatedness, surpassing the best results reported to date. They also demonstrate a clear improvement in performance on this reference standard for retrofitted vector representations, as compared to those without retrofitting.},

In this research, we adapt these measures to the SNOMED-CT\textregistered{} ontology of medical concepts. The measures include two path-based measures, and three measures that augment path-based measures with information content statistics from corpora. We also derive a context vector measure based on medical corpora that can be used as a measure of semantic relatedness. These six measures are evaluated against a newly created test bed of 30 medical concept pairs scored by three physicians and nine medical coders. We find that the medical coders and physicians differ in their ratings, and that the context vector measure correlates most closely with the physicians, while the path-based measures and one of the information content measures correlates most closely with the medical coders. We conclude that there is a role both for more flexible measures of relatedness based on information derived from corpora, as well as for measures that rely on existing ontological structures.},

The proposed conceptual matching supports problem solving and inferencing (using high-level, generic concepts) based on readily available data (typically represented as low-level, specific concepts). Through the identification of semantically similar concepts, conceptual matching also enables reasoning in the absence of exact, or even approximate, lexical matching.

We then trained them on a large electronic health records (EHR) database containing about 50 million patients to generate concept embeddings and evaluated them for both intrinsic evaluations focusing on concept similarity measure and an extrinsic evaluation to assess the use of generated concept embeddings in the task of predicting disease onset.ResultsOur experiments show that embeddings learned from information within one visit (time window zero) improve performance on the concept similarity measure and the FastText algorithm usually had better performance than the other two algorithms. For the predictive modeling task, the optimal result was achieved by word2vec embeddings with a 30-day sliding window.ConclusionsConsidering time constraints are important in training clinical concept embeddings. We expect they can benefit a series of downstream applications.},

  abstract = {Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied in predicting disease onset risks with Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. While these models demonstrated promising results on relatively small data sets, the generalizability and transferability of those models and its applicability to different patient populations across hospitals have not been evaluated. In this study, we evaluated an RNN model, RETAIN, over Cerner Health Facts\textregistered{} EMR data, for heart failure onset risk prediction. Our data set included over 150,000 heart failure patients and over 1,000,000 controls from nearly 400 hospitals. Convincingly, RETAIN achieved an AUC of 82\% in comparison to an AUC of 79\% for logistic regression, demonstrating the power of more expressive deep learning models for EHR predictive modeling. The prediction performance fluctuated across different patient groups and varied from hospital to hospital. Also, we trained RETAIN models on individual hospitals and found that the model can be applied to other hospitals with only about 3.6\% of reduction of AUC. Our results demonstrated the capability of RNN for predictive modeling with large and heterogeneous EHR data, and pave the road for future improvements.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole versus placebo as adjunctive treatment to standard antidepressant therapy (ADT) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who showed an incomplete response to 1 prospective and 1 to 3 historical courses of ADT within the current episode.
Method: The study comprised a 7- to 28-day screening phase, an 8-week prospective treatment phase, and a 6-week double-blind treatment phase. Patients with DSM-IV-TR\textendash{}defined MDD were enrolled between June 16, 2004, and April 27, 2006. During prospective treatment, patients received ADT: escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine controlled-release, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended-release, each with single-blind, adjunctive placebo. Incomplete responders continued ADT and were randomly assigned to double-blind, adjunctive placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole (2\textendash{}15 mg/day with fluoxetine or paroxetine; 2\textendash{}20 mg/day with all others). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from end of prospective treatment to end of doubleblind treatment (week 14, last observation carried forward) in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (analysis of covariance).
Results: A total of 178 patients were randomly assigned to adjunctive placebo and 184 to adjunctive aripiprazole. Baseline demographics were similar between groups (mean MADRS total score of 26.0). Mean change in MADRS total score was significantly greater with adjunctive aripiprazole (\textendash{}8.8) than adjunctive placebo (\textendash{}5.8; p {$<$} .001). Adverse events (AEs) that occurred in {$\geq$} 10\% of patients with adjunctive placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole were akathisia (4.5\% vs. 23.1\%), headache (10.8\% vs. 6.0\%), and restlessness (3.4\% vs. 14.3\%). Discontinuations due to AEs were low with adjunctive placebo (1.7\%) and adjunctive aripiprazole (2.2\%); only 1 adjunctive aripiprazole\textendash{}treated patient discontinued due to akathisia.
Conclusions: In patients with MDD who showed an incomplete response to ADT, adjunctive aripiprazole was efficacious and well tolerated. Clinical Trials Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00095823. (J Clin Psychiatry 2007;68:843\textendash{}853)},

  title = {Evaluation of a Method to Identify and Categorize Section Headers in Clinical Documents},
  volume = {16},
  issn = {1527-974X},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical notes, typically written in natural language, often contain substructure that divides them into sections, such as "History of Present Illness" or "Family Medical History." The authors designed and evaluated an algorithm ("SecTag") to identify both labeled and unlabeled (implied) note section headers in "history and physical examination" documents ("H\&P notes").
DESIGN: The SecTag algorithm uses a combination of natural language processing techniques, word variant recognition with spelling correction, terminology-based rules, and naive Bayesian scoring methods to identify note section headers. Eleven physicians evaluated SecTag's performance on 319 randomly chosen H\&P notes.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were the algorithm's recall and precision in identifying all document sections and a predefined list of twenty-nine major sections. A secondary outcome was to evaluate the algorithm's ability to recognize the correct start and end boundaries of identified sections.
RESULTS: The SecTag algorithm identified 16,036 total sections and 7,858 major sections. Physician evaluators classified 15,329 as true positives and identified 160 sections omitted by SecTag. The recall and precision of the SecTag algorithm were 99.0 and 95.6\% for all sections, 98.6 and 96.2\% for major sections, and 96.6 and 86.8\% for unlabeled sections. The algorithm determined the correct starting and ending text boundaries for 94.8\% of labeled sections and 85.9\% of unlabeled sections.
CONCLUSIONS: The SecTag algorithm accurately identified both labeled and unlabeled sections in history and physical documents. This type of algorithm may assist in natural language processing applications, such as clinical decision support systems or competency assessment for medical trainees.},

The study compared the efficacy and tolerability of a range of antidepressant therapies through four sequential levels of treatment with the goal of achieving remission. Remission rates based on the primary outcome measure (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) were 28\% (Level 1 citalopram), 17\% to 30\% (Level 2 treatments), 12\% to 25\% (Level 3 treatments), and 7\% to 14\% (Level 4 treatments). For patients not responding adequately to an initial trial of citalopram, subsequent treatment strategies may be effective. When more treatment steps are required, however, lower acute remission rates, greater degrees of treatment intolerance, and higher relapse rates during follow up are seen. There were few differences among treatments within each level related to efficacy or tolerability, although patients had clear preferences for or against certain treatments.},
